ScratchML is an educational and innovative project inspired by established machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and Theano. Our goal is to both educate on existing statistical learning methods and improve upon them, making advanced machine learning techniques more accessible and understandable.


### Key Features

- **Educational Focus**: Each module should come with extensive documentation and visual processing capabilities, making it easier for learners to understand the underlying concepts.

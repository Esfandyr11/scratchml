# ScratchML

<img src="logo.svg" alt="ScratchML Logo" width="400"/>

ScratchML is an educational and innovative project inspired by established machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and Theano. Our goal is to both educate on existing statistical learning methods and improve upon them, making advanced machine learning techniques more accessible and understandable.


### Key Features

- **Educational Focus**: Each module should come with extensive documentation and examples, making it easier for learners to understand the underlying concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with ScratchML, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scratchml.git
cd scratchml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to our [documentation](link-to-docs).

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated. Please check out our [contribution guidelines](link-to-contributing) for more information on how to get started.

## License

ScratchML is released under the [MIT License](link-to-license).

## TODO List

1. Implement Model Selection Classes
   - [ ] Create cross-validation modules (e.g., K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold)
   - [ ] Implement grid search and random search for hyperparameter tuning
   - [ ] Develop metrics for model evaluation (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

2. Implement All Linear Models
   - [ ] Develop Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
   - [ ] Implement Ridge regression (L2 regularization)
   - [ ] Create Lasso regression (L1 regularization)
   - [ ] Develop Elastic Net regression
   - [ ] Implement Logistic regression for classification tasks

3. Write Preprocessing Modules
   - [ ] Create data normalization and standardization functions
   - [ ] Implement feature scaling techniques
   - [ ] Develop modules for handling missing data
   - [ ] Create encoding methods for categorical variables
   - [ ] Implement feature selection algorithms

4. Develop Utility Modules
   - [ ] Create data loading and saving utilities
   - [ ] Implement data visualization tools
   - [ ] Develop performance profiling utilities
   - [ ] Create logging and error handling modules
   - [ ] Implement progress tracking for long-running operations

We're excited to see how ScratchML evolves as we tackle these crucial development tasks. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute to any of these areas!
